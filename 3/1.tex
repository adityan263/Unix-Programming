\section{Question 1}

Write a program that prints the owner, file type and access times of files. By
inputting a directory, the program should read the directory and print the above
information for all files in the directory.

\lstinputlisting[style=codeStyleC]{\asgnno/1.c}

The code takes 2 arguments. First input should be name of a file. Code prints
the details of that file. Second argument should be name of directory(relative/
absolute address) and it will print details of all files inside that directory.
If the given directory contains another directory inside it, it will recursively
print details of all files inside that directory.
