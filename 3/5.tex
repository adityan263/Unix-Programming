\section{Question 5}

Measures the performance of the getpid()  and the fork functions using
gettimeofday to measure the execution time. Measure the performance ten times
for each of the two system calls and provide the timing results and compute an
average for each system call.

\lstinputlisting[style=codeStyleC]{\asgnno/5.c}

In case of getpid(), the average time required remains between 6 to 8
microseconds. For the fork function, average time required is between 55 to 80
microseconds. Fork needs more time as the another copy of the program state is
created and it is more work than finding pid.
