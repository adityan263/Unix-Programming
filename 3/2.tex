\section{Question 2}

Create a FIFO file and write the programs for client-server communication. Print
the file attributes of the FIFO file during:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Before client or server starts writing to FIFO
\item After client writing a message, but before the server reading it.
\item After client writing a message and after the server reading it.
\end{enumerate}
Describe your observation and understanding

A FIFO special file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe, except that it is
accessed as part of the filesystem. The access time of file does not change when
data is written into it. For access time to change, the data that is written
must be read by some other process and then only the time changes.
