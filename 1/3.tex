What will be the output for the program with following operation?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new file “f1” and write “abcde” in it and close

If we open a file using O\_APPEND flag, every time before writing into the file,
it is checked whether the file is opened using append mode and if it is then the
write pointer is moved to end of the file.
