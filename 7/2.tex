\section{Question 2}

child send SIGINT to its parent if exists and kill it? Verify with a sample
program.

When parent sleeps for 5 seconds, child sends SIGINT to parent pid and exits. As
sleep function returns the unslept time, so by doing some operations in signal
handler or by checking return value of sleep, we can determine whether parent has
received signal from child or not.
