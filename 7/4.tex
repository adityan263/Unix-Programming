“Child inherit parent’s signal mask when it is created, but pending signals for
the parent process are not passed on”. Write appropriate program and test with
suitable inputs to verify this.

Initially, a mask is set for SIGINT and then the process sends SIGINT to itself.
As SIGINT is masked, signal remains pending. Then the process forks and parent
and child both check their masks and pending signals. The mask of parent process
is inherited by child, but child doesn't inherit pending signals. In the end
both parent and child unmask the SIGINT signal, but signal handler is called for
parent only. This again shows that pending signals are not inherited.
