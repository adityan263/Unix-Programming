\section{Question 2}

A function realpath() resolves all symbolic links in path and returns the
ultimate target. Write a program to simulate realpath() to list the ultimate
target of the only filename that are symbolic links in a directory. The program
takes one optional argument, which is the name of a directory to be searched for
the links. When no argument is specified, the search is conducted in the current
working directory.

This code takes file/directory address as input and returns real path of the
given file. Code traverses on the file name string and for each directory in
that address it checks if it is a link using stat function and S\_ISLNK. If it is
a link, it will read the address(link) inside it and replace it in the original
string. Thus a final string is generated which may contain ../ or ./ which
are removed in the next traversal.
