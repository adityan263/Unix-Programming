\section{Question 6}

umask() always sets the process umask and, at the same time, returns a copy of
the old umask. How can we obtain a copy of the current process umask while
leaving it unchanged? Write a program to demonstrate.

Fork function creates 2 threads with different process ids. Parent function
retains its original pid while child function runs with pid=0. As umask is
executed when pid==0, mask will change for child process and not for parent
process.
