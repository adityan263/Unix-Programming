\section{Question 3}

Write a Server-client logging architecture with mmap() inter process
communication feature. The log client sends log messages and log server handles
all messages from different log clients and writes to a DB file.

\subsection{Server}
\lstinputlisting[style=codeStyleC]{3s.c}
\subsection{Client}
\lstinputlisting[style=codeStyleC]{3c.c}

Memory is allocated to a file named "logs.txt" and server and client communicate
with eachother by reading and writing into this file.
