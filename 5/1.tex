\section{Question 1}

Write a program to do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a child

\item Let the child

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create it’s own foreground process group.

\item Call “ps” and verify the above

\item Verify that STDIN and STDOUT working with the child
\end{enumerate}

\item Wait for the child to terminate

\item Change its group to foreground

\item Verify that STDIN and STDOUT working with the parent
\end{enumerate}

Initially child creates a new process group. As child is no longer part of
foreground process, the parent has to execute tcsetpgrp() to make child's group
foreground process. Once the child's process group is in foreground, it tries to
read and write, and then it makes parent's group foreground process and exits.
